# Hoplon [![build status][14]][15] ![epicycles][11]

[](dependency)
```clojure
[hoplon "6.0.0-alpha17"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

Hoplon is a set of tools and libraries for making web applications.

Hoplon provides a compiler for web application frontend development, and includes
the following libraries as dependencies to complete the stack:

* [Javelin][1]: a spreadsheet-like dataflow library for managing client
  state. Hoplon tightly integrates with Javelin to reactively bind DOM
  elements to the underlying Javelin cell graph.
* [Castra][2]: a full-featured RPC library for Clojure and
  ClojureScript, providing the serverside environment.

### Example

```clojure
(page "index.html")

(defn my-list [& items]
  (div
    :class "my-list"
    (apply ul (map #(li (div :class "my-list-item" %)) items))))

(def clicks (cell 0))

(html
  (head
    (title "example page"))
  (body
    (h1 "Hello, Hoplon")

    (my-list
      (span "first thing")
      (span "second thing"))

    (p (text "You've clicked ~{clicks} times, so far."))
    (button :click #(swap! clicks inc) "click me")))
```

Or, equivalently:

```xml
<script type="text/hoplon">
  ;; Page declaration specifies output file path.
  (page "index.html")

  ;; definitions are optional
  (defn my-list [& items]
    (div
      :class "my-list"
      (apply ul (map #(li (div :class "my-list-item" %)) items))))

  (def clicks (cell 0))
</script>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>example page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, Hoplon</h1>

    <!-- an HTML syntax call to the my-list function -->
    <my-list>
      <span>first thing</span>
      <span>second thing</span>
    </my-list>

    <!-- using dataflow to link DOM and Javelin cells -->
    <p><text>You've clicked ~{clicks} times, so far.</text></p>
    <button click="{{ #(swap! clicks inc) }}">click me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Browser Support

Hoplon has been thoroughly tested on desktop and mobile devices against the
following browsers:

![IEdge](https://img.shields.io/badge/IEdge-8%2B-blue.svg) ![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-14%2B-orange.svg) ![Safari](https://img.shields.io/badge/Safari-5%2B-blue.svg)
![Chrome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome-26%2B-yellow.svg) ![Opera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Opera-11%2B-red.svg)
![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-4%2B-green.svg)

>Note that the `object` element is not implemented for IE 8, and that older
browsers that predate HTML 5 elements such as `Audio` and `Video` will not render
them.  Additionally, boot development tasks such as `boot-reload` and
`boot-cljs-repl`, which inject scripts into the browser to function, do not
support IE 8 (which errors when output is written to the console without the
developer tools open).  Testing against these browsers is best done with simple
or advanced optimizations turned on.
