# Hoplon

Hoplon is a set of tools and libraries for making web applications.

Hoplon provides a compiler for web application frontend development, and includes
the following libraries as dependencies to complete the stack:

* [Javelin][1]: a spreadsheet-like dataflow library for managing client
  state. Hoplon tightly integrates with Javelin to reactively bind DOM
  elements to the underlying Javelin cell graph.
* [Castra][2]: a full-featured RPC library for Clojure and
  ClojureScript, providing the serverside environment. (optional)

### Quickstart

Install [Boot](http://boot-clj.com) and then generate a starter project with:

    boot -d boot/new new -t hoplon -n hoplon-starter-project

### Example

`src/pages/index.cljs`:

```clojure
(page "index.html")

(ns ^{:hoplon/page "index.html"} pages.index
  (:require [hoplon.core  :as h :refer [div ul li html head title body h1 span p button text]]
            [javelin.core :as j :refer [cell cell=]]
            [hoplon.jquery]))

(defn my-list [& items]
  (div
    :class "my-list"
    (apply ul (map #(li (div :class "my-list-item" %)) items))))

(def clicks (cell 0))

(html
  (head
    (title "example page"))
  (body
    (h1 "Hello, Hoplon")

    (my-list
      (span "first thing")
      (span "second thing"))

    (p (text "You've clicked ~{clicks} times, so far."))
    (button :click #(swap! clicks inc) "click me")))
```

### Browser Support

Hoplon has been thoroughly tested on desktop and mobile devices against the
following browsers:

![IEdge](https://img.shields.io/badge/IEdge-10%2B-blue.svg) ![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-14%2B-orange.svg) ![Safari](https://img.shields.io/badge/Safari-5%2B-blue.svg)
![Chrome](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome-26%2B-yellow.svg) ![Opera](https://img.shields.io/badge/Opera-11%2B-red.svg)
![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-4%2B-green.svg)

>Note that the `object` element is not implemented for IE 8, and that older
browsers that predate HTML 5 elements such as `Audio` and `Video` will not render
them.  Additionally, boot development tasks such as `boot-reload` and
`boot-cljs-repl`, which inject scripts into the browser to function, do not
support IE 8 (which errors when output is written to the console without the
developer tools open).  Testing against these browsers is best done with simple
or advanced optimizations turned on.
